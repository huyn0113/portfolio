# REFLECTION INTERVIEW

## Q: Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes. What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?

* A: When it came to developing my website, I found that being able to utilize frameworks such as Bootstrap and Javascript made my workload lighter and kept me more organized. However, there were instances where I was faced with small challenges. The challenges I ran into were tasks that I hadn't explored thoroughly. An example would be, learning how to work with the frameworks and replace the content with my own. In both scenarios I had to work with carousels. The first round, I had to imbed videos, and the second time, it was figuring out how to implement a second carousel. Since I was working with parts of code that I didn't know how to troubleshoot right away, I simply had to do some research in order to overcome them. Really, all it took was figuring out what code I needed to use on w3schools, and replacing it with what I wanted. From there, it just took tinkering with a few values and I ended up with the outcome I was looking for. The same would apply to my second issue except I did more troubleshooting on my own by recalling things I've learnt. I quickly realized that the reason why my second carousel wasn't appearing was because my id was no longer considered unique hence causing a conflict for both carousels. *

* During the process of creating my site, I learned that there are definetly aspects of code that if I knew about more, I could have made my site a lot more interesting. While I included javascript into my site, it was because the resources were there when I went looking. However, if I were to have known about the extents and purposes of javascript, I believe I could have added more elements. *
